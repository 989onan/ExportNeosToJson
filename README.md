# ExportNeosToJson

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows exporting items to 7zbson. This allows items to be backed up locally.

## Installation
1. [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [ExportNeosToJson.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/ExportNeosToJson/releases/latest/download/ExportNeosToJson.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## FAQ
### What does this actually do?
It injects an additional 7zbson option into the export dialog.

### Why NeosModLoader over some other mod loader?
Because this does not violate the [Neos Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqdbIvbj1b2LeFhNzfAASeTpRZk6vmbXISYLdTXTVR4/edit#).
